# West Tokyo JALT Podcast

ADD AN IMAGE LATER

This podcast is produced by my colleagues and me as a supplement to the events and activities that we run through the West Tokyo chapter of the Japan Association of Language Teachers (JALT).

When possible, podcasts are recorded following our regular events with the speaker. While they follow up on the presentations that were given, they offer a more intimate feel through discussion that was not possible during the event itself. 

Click below to view the latest episode, a talk with Dr. Andy Boon on Extensive Reading.
