**Describing places with "where"**

We can use many adjectives to describe places, such as crowded (混んでいる), dirty (汚い), beautiful, historical (歴史が長い), exciting, comfortable (いい感じ), and so on.

An easy sentence would be to say, "Tokyo is exciting."
But we can tell more information if we use "where".
Look at this sentence
*Tokyo is a city where there are many wonderful restaurants.*

To make this, we need a complete sentence
Ex. There are many wonderful restaurants.
Ex 2. People are very busy.
Ex 3. You can find many shops.

Now you put "Tokyo is a city where" in front of that sentence.
Ex. Tokyo is a city where there are many wonderful restaurants.
Ex 2. Tokyo is a city where people are very busy.
Ex 3. Tokyo is a city where you can find many shops.

BUT you must have a full sentence. These are not correct.
NG! Tokyo is a city where many wonderful restaurants.
NG2! Tokyo is a city where very busy.
NG3! Tokyo is a city where many shops.

**Liaison: word sounds coming together**

The English alphabet is made of vowels and consonants.
The vowels are A, E, I, O, U and sometimes Y (when it sounds like "ee" like in "funny").
The other letters are consonants.

I like to say that vowels are weak. They need help. They need projection when they are at the front of a word..

Look at these words.
An apple

Oh no! The "a" in "apple" is weak. It's at the front of the word. It needs protection. Who will help it?
The "n" in "An" will help. It goes to the front of "apple"
So, it becomes "a napple"

What?!

It's a crazy example. However, when English speakers speak quickly, we put words together.
This is one way.
If a word ends with a consonant sound and the next word starts with a vowel sound, the consonant will move to the front of the next word.

So, for example, "That is a nice hat".
"That" ends with a "t". "t" is a consonant. The next word is "is". "is" starts with "i". "i" is a vowel. So the strong consonant moves to help the weak vowel.
It's the same with "is" and "a" 
Will be said like "Tha ti sa nice hat"

This is called liaison.

Please remember that spelling is not important. Only the sound is important.
Example: "One apple, please"
"One" ends in an "e", but we do not say an "e" sound. We only say the "n" sound. So, the "n" will move to help the vowel, like this.
"O napple, please."

Here is a form showing the connections in some sentences.

**Ordering at a restaurant lesson**

Restaurants in America are places where people are both very friendly and polite. 
This means both the customers and the servers (some people still say waiters or waitresses).
The reason is that the customer wants the food and experience to be good and the server wants a nice tip.
Servers in America usually do not get much money from the restaurant, but they may get a lot of money in tips.
A usual tip is now about 20% of the cost of the food.

Here are some phrases that might help you when going to a restaurant in America.

Recently my local hamburger restaurant in America is also asking for tips! So, maybe fast food service will also become a friendly and polite.

**Have you ever - experiences lesson**

*I ate a sandwich.* (simple past): we use this style to talk about usual things.

*I have eaten a cat.* (present perfect): this one uses the past participle. We use it to talk about experiences and more amazing or unusual things.

Here is a list of common verbs and their past participles.

(image: scan-10.jpg)


To make a negative version, you can say:
*I haven't ever eaten a cat*
OR
*I have never eaten a cat* (I use this one more)

Here are a list of some example sentences.

(image: scan-9.jpg)

You can also ask the questions:
*Have you eaten a cat?"
AND
*Have you ever eaten a cat?" (sounds even more amazing or unusual)

**Halloween lesson***

Asking for permission.
"Can I borrow a pen?" is casual.
"May I borrow a pen?" is more polite.
"Do you mind if I borrow a pen?" is very polite.

To answer:
A: Can/May I borrow a pen?
B: Yes. Here you are. *OR* Sorry. I don't have one.

A: Do you mind if I borrow a pen?

**When?!**

Using "too" and "not ... enough" to make complaints

"too" means ...すぎる in English.
**Too hot** means 暑すぎる.

Too small is not good. It is bad.
For example, if your friend is small, is it good or is it bad?
Maybe it is not good and it is not bad. It's your friend.
Sometimes small is good! Small dogs are very cute.
If it is good, we cannot say "too". We use "very" or "really", etc.

If you say "too small" it is bad. 
For example, if you get a shirt and it is too small, it means you are not happy that it is so small.
Maybe you can't wear it or maybe you like to wear big shirts.

Another way to say "it is too small" is to say
"it is not big enough" - it means 大きさは足りない。
It is the same.

You can see examples of complaints about these things from Afghanistan here.

So you can use this when shopping, or when returning or exchanging things.
For example, you might say this at a clothes shop.

A: Hi. Can I help you?
B: Yes. I want to buy a shirt.
A: We have this new design here. 
B: I like it, but it's too small.
A: OK, I'll get a bigger one.
B: Thank you.

Making adjectives into adverbs

(image: scan-8.jpg)

Adjectives are used with nouns.
Adverbs are used with verbs.
You can write adverbs at the start of a sentence, at the end of a sentence, before a verb, or after a verb, like this.

- Sadly, I said goodbye to Koda Kumi (OK, but sometimes it changes the meaning of the sentence)
- I sadly said goodbye to Koda Kumi (Yes!)
- I said sadly goodbye to Koda Kumi (OK, but not common with some adverbs)
- I said goodbye to Koda Kumi sadly (Yes! But not for too long of a sentence)

Pronunciation tip

English vowels (a, i e, o, u) often take a schwa sound
(image: schwa_-vector.svg.png)

Here is how it sounds
<iframe src="//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Mid-central_vowel.ogg?embedplayer=yes" width="300" height="20" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>

So, in "I want a bottle of water"
a and of use the schwa sound.


Model conversation for shopping:

A: How are you today?
B: Good. How are you?
A: Great. It's hot today.
B: Yeah, but I like it hot.
A: Ok, let's see. That's 2 bottles of water, a can of coke, and two containers of ice cream. You know, this ice cream is my favorite.
B: I like it, too.
A: That comes to $9.00.
