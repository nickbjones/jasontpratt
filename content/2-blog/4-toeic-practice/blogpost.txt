TOEIC READING SECTION PART 5: Incomplete sentences

There are usually 4 ways to decide which word is best.
だいたい４つのタイプがあります。
1. Word form. For example, should you have a noun (名詞), a verb (動詞), an adjective (形容詞), or an adverb (副詞) here?
2. Grammar.  Which verb form is best? For example, should you use present tense, simple past, or past progressive? 文法でどれがいい？過去形？別のタイプ？
3. Meaning. Usually they put all nouns, for example, or all verbs. You have to choose which one is the best here based on their meaning. 言葉のいみで決める。これでだいたいA〜D、全部は動詞とかですね。
4. Collocations. Some words are naturally used together more often than others. You would need to choose which of these is best. (時々言葉はもういつも一緒に書いています)

This lesson will focus on 1. Word form.　このレッスンで第一のWord Formを勉強します。
Specifically, let's look at 2 types of English words: Adjectives (形容詞) and Adverbs(副詞).

You probably know most of the very common adjectives in English, such as good, bad, big, fast, etc. よく使う形容詞がもう分かります。例えばgood, bad, big, fastなど）
Adjectives are very diverse, but if you see an unknown word and it ends in one of the following series of letters, it is probably an adjective:いくつの形容詞のタイプがありますが、よく最後の字で形容詞が分かります。例えば、下の字で終われば、多分形容詞です。
-   -able, -ible (comfortable, readable, incredible, invisible, etc.)
-  -al, -ial (comical, normal, musical, industrial, presidential, etc.)
-  -ful (beautiful, harmful, peaceful, wonderful, etc.)
-  -ic (classic, economic, heroic, romantic, etc.)
-  -ical (aeronautical, alphabetical, political, etc.)
-  -ish (British, childish, Irish, foolish, etc.)
-  -ive, -ative (active, alternative, creative, talkative, etc.)
-  -less (endless, motionless, priceless, timeless, etc.)
-  -eous, -ious, -ous (spontaneous, hideous, ambitious, anxious, dangerous, famous, etc.)
-  -y (angry, busy, wealthy, windy, etc.)

Adjectives usually end in -ly, but there are some that end with -wise or -wards. For example:副詞のほうがだいたい分かりやすい。ふつうにlyでおわりますが、wardsでもwiseでもおわるときもあります。
-  -ly (calmly, easily, quickly, etc.)
-  -ward(s) (downwards, homeward(s), upwards. etc.)
-  -wise (clockwise, edgewise, etc.)
(the lists is from: https://dictionary.cambridge.org/grammar/british-grammar/word-formation/suffixes)

So, which ones are adjectives? (If you don't know the word, it doesn't matter. Just look at the last letters).じゃ、どれが形容詞になりますか？
1. basic
2. ingenious
3. dastardly
4.  flamboyantly
5. comical
\----
1, 2, and 5 are adjectives.
3, 4 are adverbs.

Adjectives and adverbs can only go in certain places in a sentence.
Look at this sentence.

My brother ate a sandwich. 

Let's add these adjectives: crazy, delicious
These sentences are OK
⚪︎ My crazy brother ate a delicious sandwich.

These are not ok.
X Crazy my brother ate a sandwich delicious.

Why?
Adjectives must go in front of nouns, not after, etc.
ALSO
Adjectives can go after a be-verb.
⚪︎ The sandwich is delicious. 
X  The sandwich delicious is.

An adverb can go in many different places, though.
⚪︎ My brother quickly ate a sandwich.  (in front of the verb)
⚪︎ Quickly, my brother ate a sandwich.  (at the front of the sentence)
⚪︎ My brother ate a sandwich quickly. (at the end of the sentence)
X My quickly brother ate a sandwich. (in front of a noun if it is not the first word in the sentence)

So, which word is correct in the following sentence.
Ex. I ran to the _____ store.
A. quickly
B. barber
C. new
D. close

After the blank is the word "store". Store is a noun. So, the word in front of it should be an adjective. "New" is an adjective, but the other words are not. So the answer is C.
