8. Nine out of ten cakes you ever eat will be too dry.I can't really imagine a scenario where your pie would be dry. You would have to try really hard to make a dry pie... unless you're a poser [see # 6 above].

9. Chocolate cake doesn't really taste like chocolate. Chocolate pie tastes the most like chocolate.

10. Miniature pies (i.e. hand pies) are awesome. Miniature cakes (i.e. cupcakes) are annoying and were developed as an excuse for psychos to coerce consumers into believing mo' frosting is mo' better. Don't drink the water--mo' frosting IS NOT mo' better.

11. Don't care how many layers are there, cake is shallow. It's all about show-- stacking tall, frosting spackled tight and smooth along its curves, glazes dripping hungrily for anyone who'll look. That's right, that cake--pretty as it is--is more hungry for you than you are for it. Pie, on the other hand, isn't hustling for anyone's approval. It can be kind of messy--imperfect edges, sometimes spills over a little, bubbly, juicy, doesn't always cut clean. Sure, pie can also be graceful, elegant, and beautiful... but pie is never concerned with the attention of those who are are memorized by the noise of those seeking attention (*cough* cake). We could all take a note from pie's wisdom and confidence.

12. You feed cake to children because: A.) it won't choke them and B.) because their palates aren't developed, and all they know is sugar=good. You feed pie to adults because they can chew their food properly and [hopefully] appreciate flavor.

13. Pot pie is awesome. Pot cake... sounds like a misdemeanor.

14. You eat pie because you want a real dessert (or breakfast/lunch/dinner). You eat cake because it happens to be there.
