**【 Absences and Late Arrivals 】**
1. 4+ absences = no credit.
2. Late policy: 
    * 15 minutes or more late to class = absent
    * If you are late to class, I will add the time to your late record.
    *Each time your late record reaches 15 minutes, you have 1 more absence.
	-Example: Day 1: Late 6 minutes, Day 2: Late 3 minutes, Day 3: Late 7 minutes. Total = 16 minutes. So, it’s 1 absent and 1 minute.
    * Train passes = Not accepted
3. If you have a school-approved absence form, your absence will be forgiven. In issues of difficult sickness or other really unavoidable circumstances, even without a form from the school, the teacher may forgive you, but you must have a note from the doctor, the police, or some other related person. 
4. Sleeping, using a cell phone (without my permission), or otherwise not participating in class will be counted as an absence.
