**【 Absences and Late Arrivals 】**

1. 5 or more absences = no credit.
2. Late policy: 
    * 1 minute late = late
    * 3 times late = 1 absence
    * 15 minutes or more late to class = absent
    *  Train passes = Not accepted
3. If you have a school-approved absence form, your absence will be forgiven. In issues of difficult sickness or other really unavoidable circumstances, even without a form from the school, the teacher may forgive you, but you must have a note from the doctor, the police, or some other related person. 
4. Sleeping, using a cell phone (without my permission), or otherwise not participating in class will be counted as an absence.
Note 1: You should be at school at least 10 minutes early, so if your train is late, but by less than 10 minutes, it is not forgiven.
Note 2: Train passes = Not accepted.

**【 Stamps – how to get 】**

1. 10% of your grade will come from your stamp card.
2. 1 stamp = 1%.
3. There are 20 spots. If you get more than 10 stamps, this is extra credit.
4. The stamps can come from the list below. You can do these from today until 1 day before the last class.
    * 1 stamp: Make a 1-minute video where you talk alone using the language from class that week (means after class on Friday until class begins on Friday)
    * 1 stamp: Make a recording (voice or video are both ok) of you singing an English karaoke song.
    * 1 stamp: Go to the English lounge
    * 2 stamps: Go to an English lounge special event
    * 2 stamps each: Make a 2-minute video where you have a conversation with one other Japanese person using the language from the class that week.
    * 4 stamps: Make a recording (voice or video are both ok) of you speaking with a foreigner for 30 seconds (please see the list of manners for this). Any topic is OK!
    * ?? stamps: YOUR IDEA! If you have an idea, tell me. If it is nice, we can decide how many points to give.
    * Video homework rules and notes
       - You cannot look at a script or any paper while doing a video.
       - You have to speak fluently. That means you should try for 60 or more words a minute. It is OK if your English is not perfect and you make mistakes! However, you must show that you understand the target language. 
       - You can see an example video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwHj1XyXqxg 
       - You cannot make the videos during class time. They must be made outside of class times. You cannot make them in the English Lounge, either.
    * If you choose the karaoke activity and make an audio recording, you have to prove to me it is you. Maybe you can say something before singing.
    * Video files and audio files must be sent to me. It is ok to e-mail them if they are small, but it is better to upload them to a web site like dropbox or Youtube (you can make it a private video and send me the link). 
    * You must show me your stamp card when it is all finished or on the last day of class.
    * If you lose your stamp card, you may lose all of your points.


*Manners for making a video with a foreign person*

1. Please ask the person if it is OK to make the video. Do not start filming them.
2. A person from any country except Japan is OK. They do not have to be a native English speaker.
3. You can start talking to them like this.

“Hello. I am an English language student. Do you have time to talk?”

> If they say no, say:

> “OK. Thank you anyway. Have a nice day.”

> If they say yes, say this

“My name is [your name] . My teacher asked me talk with a person from another country for 30 seconds or longer. We can talk about anything. I have to record it. Is it OK?”

> If they say no, say:

> “OK. Thank you anyway. Have a nice day.”

If they say yes, please talk to them and record it. When you are finished, say

“Thank you for your time. I really appreciate it. Have a nice day.”
