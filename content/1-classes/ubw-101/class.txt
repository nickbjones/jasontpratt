    **Some notes from class if you missed it**

    Today we talked about how to pluck a
    chicken, later we will learn how this is
    relevant to weaving baskets.

Intro: Hands-on instruction of basket weaving in an aquatic environment. We will not be using any kind of breathing apparatuses; those are for fakers; we will be learning to hold our breath while we weave, like real men. I do not accept tardiness.
