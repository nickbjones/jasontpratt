Today we studied how to make stop motion videos. 
When I was in high school, it was my dream to be a famous Youtuber, so I was really interested in learning more about making videos. I was happy to learn in Jason's class about how to make beautiful shots using good lighting and how to take the best kinds of photos. I wanted to be a Youtuber again! Actually, I wanted to do live videos, not stop motion, but this information could help me to make my live videos.
I also learned from Manna about how to tell a good story in a video. I thought that my favorite YouTubers were just making crazy videos and not planning. Now, I understand that my favorite videos are telling a kind of story - even if it seems like there is no story.
So now I am ready to consider making my own great videos.

Actually, I think Youtube is great for learning. So many interesting videos are made in English, so I get motivation to improve my English and I learn from the videos. Also, people from all over the world are making Youtube videos, so I can understand other cultures and ways of thinking.

I am looking forward to next class.
